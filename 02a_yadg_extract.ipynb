    "\n",
    "Since `yadg-5.0`, it is possible to access the file parsing functionality of several of the implemented filetypes, using the `yadg extract` command. An up-to-date list of exposed *Extractors* is shown in the [**yadg extractors** section of the sidebar](https://dgbowl.github.io/yadg/5.1/index.html) in the project documentation. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use yadg on the command line to extract the data from a BioLogic `.mpr` file, and the meta-data from a PANalytical `.xrdml` file."

As shown in the above usage, to extract the data, we need to specify the `filetype` (in this case `eclab.mpr`) and the input file (using the `infile` argument). The output file path `[outfile]` is optional and will default to the basename of the `infile` with a `.nc` suffix.\n",
